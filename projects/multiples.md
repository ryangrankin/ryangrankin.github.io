Multiples of 3 is a project I developed for my ICS 212 classs using C++. This project takes a user inputted max number and displays whether each number from 0 to max inputted number is a multiple of 3. The answers are formatted in a Yes/No chart for each number. The application doesn't accept negative numbers.
