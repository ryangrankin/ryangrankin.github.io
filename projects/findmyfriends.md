Find my Friends is a group project app created for ICS314. I was responsible for the group events section, which allows users to view pre-existing group events, rsvp to the them, as well as post thier own group events. This works with the rest of this application- which allows users to create a profile outlining thier interests, view other users profiles, and chat with other users. This app is a full stack project build using Next.js, TypeScript, and deployed using vercel.
