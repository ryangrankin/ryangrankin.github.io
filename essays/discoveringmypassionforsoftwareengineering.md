Software Engineering has stood out to me since I began to explore career opportunities my senior year of highschool. Growing up doing ‘Girls who code’ workshops and learning from my parents, who are both engineers, I realized that software engineering perfectly combines the elements I was seeking. It excites me because it combines creativity with logical problem solving- two things that I really enjoy. Although I am still building and improving the skills I need to excel in this field, I am eager to grow by learning to design and build projects that can solve real world problems. 

## My Interest in Software Engineering:

As someone who always seeks social connection, I am excited to be a part of a field that requires collaboration with others with diverse skills and backgrounds. I like talking to people and building important social ties, and I believe that that will help me to be a great software engineer. Effective software development should not depend solely on coding, but also working with and sharing ideas with others to bring ideas to life. 

## My Current Goals: 

I am currently focused on developing programming skills to build the foundation of my knowledge in core software engineering principles. I want to become more familiar with coding languages and tools that will be expected in daily use as a software engineer. Beyond this, I hope to gain experience in problem solving and building the neural connection to become an efficient and effective problem solver. 

## My Future Goals: 

I look forward to growing my interpersonal and communication skills in professional settings, and hope to make more social connections with people in my field of study. I hope to improve my ability to connect with and maintain professional connections and relationships, as building a network of peers and mentors will no doubt serve me well as I enter work post grad. 

## All in All: 

In summary, while I am still building my portfolio of skills, my passion for learning and problem solving, along with my love for social interaction motivates me to take software engineering seriously. I want to develop social skills that will help me contribute effectively in the future to software projects and teams. I aim to grow into a well rounded professional by being a dedicated student and using my practical experience.
